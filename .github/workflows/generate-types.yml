# On pull request, check that the typescript definitions are up-to-date with the Postgres schema
# This ensures that conflicting upstream changes are caught at build time
# We can catch issue with
#  - any new changes made to the database that would effect existing/upstream frontend code
#  - any new changes made to the frontend that are not up to date with the upstream database schema
